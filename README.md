# Project Day 1:

- I started my Tic Tac Toe project by downloading a zip file with project info

- I created a GitHub account and Repository I named my ....Project TTT

- I pushed an empty repository doc to test it was syncing up to GitHub 

# Project Day 2:

- Originally I created 5 user stories - they were actual stories so I had to recreate user story steps.

- I did draw a wireframe on paper then took a picture and I uploaded pictures to GitHub Enterprise  - of course it changed a lot so the original design was eventually replaced as I worked on the project.

- I started with the Sign Up,Sign-In,Change Password and Sign-Out using ur template from Jquery /Ajax token authentication. Primarily because I knew it worked.

# Project Day 3:

- I made a graph/ table I did this after many errors and google searches I was able to get the right squares I was looking for.

- I used div-buttons-row class ect...

- For me I needed a visual of what I was trying to manipulate.

- My struggles were constantly getting a blank screen or a revert to old screen anytime I put the code in a place it didnt like. Ugh !

- I spent this day trying to get X and O to show up.
- At first I tried making my own code and that didnt work, then I started using Google.
  I copied and pasted a LOT of code I found on Stack Overflow, W3 schools and code academy.
- I  worked in html and scss. NO X or O

# Project Day 4:

- Today I was stagnet- I found out that more code is NOT neccessarily better .

- I spent 1/2 of my day deleting extra code that did nothing.

- I was finally able to get X and O to populate in events.js
yay!

- I learned quickly to commit after any success because I did have to revert back to a PREVIOUS COMMIT!

# Project Day 5:

- Sign in-out-up Change Password was tested and works.

- Today was all about call handlers for my RESTART button.

- I also couldnt get X to always be the first letter when I restarted the game so... 

- I ended up having to move my "PlayerXTurn=true'
from events.js into index.js for my game to start with X every time. Honestly, I have no idea why that worked...but it did.
 
- I wrapped up with sending up to github


# Things I still need to do:

- A button to keep score.

- I have code started to determine a winner( and announce you win!)but its not working     yet.
